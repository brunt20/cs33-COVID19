# cs33-Health Data Analytics - What Social Tweets Tell us about COVID-19?

# Project Description:
Massive amount of data is being generated everyday through different platforms such as social media and proprietary software systems. In the recent COVID-19 outbreak, social media platforms have been overwhelmed with data about coronavirus, especially from the public, in the form of social tweets or posts. Such data can be invaluable source for identifying social insights that can help health and government agencies to better understand essential trends from peopleâ€™s point of view.

# The goal of this project is to analyse tweets data to identify and explore insights including:
1. Cluster/categorise COVID health-related information
2. Perform a sentiment analysis to evaluate the sentiments of users to correlate with mental health.
